# UrgentMatter

> UrgentMatter, where work gets ~~done~~ *set to pending*.

UrgentMatter is Jira clone of the highest caliber. Actually, it was a going away gag for a good friend who is intimately familar with the trials and tribulations of life in an IT department. This little ditty is packed full of inside jokes and digs at Microsoft.
